# numericals

> THIS PROJECT IS UNSTABLE YET. THINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
> 
> Since October 2022, `dense-numericals` is only supported with `extensible-compound-types`. Without it, the relevant polymorphic-functions can take too long to compile on SBCL even when compiled with `(optimize compilation-speed)`. Use `numericals` if you do not want to use `extensible-compound-types`.

See [digikar99.github.io/numericals/](https://digikar99.github.io/numericals/) for documentation.
